      Hello, my name is Ramona. And I want to present you my website, it contains a contact page with my contact details, a page with a CV where I put it all the information about my work until now, and the most important, a portfolio which soon will be filled with my business computing work. Making this website was a challenge but at the same time was very fun, because we had the occasion to use our knowledge, we made everything from scratch and use our best tools to make our first website.
