        <h1>Site report</h1>
        <p>I am glad I had the chance to work on this website and demonstrate my skills and what I have learned during this semester, the project has 5 pages, and I started this website with the index page, when I was almost ready with it, the page looks like this:</p>
        <img src="index-report1.png" alt="sitereport1" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>With a short description of myself, together with a photo which is also an animation</p>
        <img src="index-report2.png" alt="sitereport1" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>If you hold your mouse over the photo, the photo will change with another one:</p>
        <img src="index-report3.png" alt="sitereport1" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>The first color that I used was ''cornsilk'', I have decided that is not the perfect color for the website, so I change it with pale violet color, from pink to cornsilk, after that, to violet, to be easy to read the text.
            Next page that I made was the CV one, that page was a little bit harder to make because I could not decide about how to arrange the columns, fist I tried to make only two columns, but it seems to me that the spaces between the text was too much, and I decided to combine them. I used the Georgia font for the header, simply because is a font that I personally love, I was thinking about typewriter as well, but it seems to me not right for the page, I used Times new roman for the text, because in my perspective it looks elegant and it is a match with Georgia font. In the end i used display grid and now it is looking like this:</p>
        <img src="cv-report1.png" alt="sitereport3" width="750" height="450"/>
        <img src="cv-report2.png" alt="sitereport3" width="750" height="450"/>
        <img src="cv-report3.png" alt="sitereport3" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>The contact page was quite difficult, but in the end, I managed to do it as good as I can. The background is also a lighter one, making everything easy to read and comfortable for the eyes. First time, I chose Arial font. Later, I kept the colour, but I changed the font with something preferable for me, Georgia font.</p> 
        <p>And it looks like this:</p>
        <img src="contact-report.png" alt="sitereport3" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>For the portfolio page, first I chose only 3 columns, but I wanted to fill all the space and I thought would be a good idea to make 4, with 25%. I choose pictures of landscapes to make the columns with, simply because I love nature and I thought that those pictures are amazing.</p>
        <p>The final page looks like this:</p>
        <img src="portofolio-report1.png" alt="sitereport6" width="750" height="450"/>
        <img src="portofolio-report2.png" alt="sitereport6" width="750" height="450"/>
        <p>I tried to keep a similar feature for all the pages, I did that choosing a lighter colour for the background, I am a minimalistic person, so I tried to make the website simple and elegant, using two font that I love.</p>
        
        <p>Down below I will include screenshots with my HTML and CSS codes validated.</p>
